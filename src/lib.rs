//! Non-leased object-pooling in Rust.
//!
//! Non-leased as in: objects are not passed out from the Pool, but can
//! be acted upon synchronously. This means that the logic for re-creating
//! and choosing the next item can be done by the pool.
//!
//! # Getting started
//!
//! Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! fpool = "0.1"
//! ```
//!
//! Next, add this to your crate:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! extern crate fpool;
//! ```
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! A trivial use-case for a round-robin pool:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use fpool::RoundRobinPool;
//!
//! let mut pool = RoundRobinPool::builder(5, || {
//!     Ok(Vec::new())
//! }).build().expect("No constructor failure case");
//!
//! for index in 0..10 {
//!     pool.act_mut(|list| {
//!         list.push(index);
//!         true // action succeeded and item is still valid
//!     }).expect("No constructor failure case");
//! }
//!
//! // The pool now has 5 lists with 2 items each
//! for _ in 0..5 {
//!     pool.act(|list| {
//!         assert_eq!(list.len(), 2);
//!         true // action succeeded and item is still valid
//!     }).expect("No constructor failure case");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! But a more useful and realistic example is a thread-pool, see
//! ./examples/thread_pool.rs.
#[macro_use] extern crate failure;

mod pool;

pub use pool::*;
