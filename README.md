# fpool
Non-leased object-pooling in Rust.

Non-leased as in: you cannot hold onto objects given from the Pool.
This, unfortunately, is not something I could get enforced by the compiler
without making the API hard to work with.

# Getting started

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
fpool = "0.3"
```

Next, add this to your crate:

```no_run
extern crate fpool;
```

# Examples

A trivial use-case for a round-robin pool:

```rust
use fpool::RoundRobinPool;

let mut pool = RoundRobinPool::builder(5, || -> Result<_, ()> {
    Ok(Vec::new())
}).build().expect("No constructor failure case");

for index in 0..10 {
 let list = pool.get().expect("No constructor failure case");
 list.push(index);
}

// The pool now has 5 lists with 2 items each
for _ in 0..5 {
 let list = pool.get().expect("No constructor failure case");
 assert_eq!(list.len(), 2);
}
```

But a more useful and realistic example is a thread-pool, see
[examples/thread_pool.rs](https://github.com/DarrenTsung/fpool/blob/master/examples/thread_pool.rs).
